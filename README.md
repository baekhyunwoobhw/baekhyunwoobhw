### Interests

When I'm not immersed in my studies or research, I find my escape and rejuvenation in the thrill of outdoor adventures. Whether it's the freedom of the open road on my motorcycle, the challenge of scaling a new climbing route, or the serenity of camping under the stars, I’m always seeking new experiences in nature. Motorcycling gives me a sense of liberation and connection with the environment, while climbing pushes my physical and mental limits, demanding focus and resilience. Camping, on the other hand, offers a peaceful retreat, where I can unwind, reflect, and appreciate the simplicity of life in the wilderness. These activities not only provide a balance to my academic pursuits but also fuel my passion for exploration and personal growth.
